- 👋 Hi, I’m Ifedolapo

- 👀 I'm a frontend developer with an eye for detail and a love for creating magic with code.
- 💻 I'm on the final lap of my journey with alxafrica software engineering program. A program that has made me a completely different developer than I once was
- 🌱 My tech stack includes React JS, Javascript, Html and CSS, Python, Flask, Bash.
- 💞️ My greatest feature though is How willingly I am to pick new technologies, and how dedicated I am to my craft
