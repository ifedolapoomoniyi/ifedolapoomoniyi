- 👋 Hi, I’m @ifedolapoomoniyi
- 👨‍🎓 I am a medical student with great passion for tech. You could say i'm currently learning how to fix human bugs😅
- 👀 I’ve gone down the popular html, css and js route but it left me feeling limited, dare i say.... Incomplete
- 💻 I recently joined @alxafrica on their one year software engineering course to help broaden my view of what SE really entails.
- 🌱 I’m versed and have built projects in Html, Css, JS, React, bash scripting, ubuntu linux, C (project coming real soon)
- 💞️ If you ever need an hardworking overachiever😅, please send an email. I'm an excellent "on the job" learner too.
- 📫 How to reach me... Email is probably best. Here ifedolapo0001@gmail.com or twitter @ife_ifedolapo but I mostly only retweet lionel Messi prop⚽.
