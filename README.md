- 👨‍🎓 I am a student of ALX Africa, here to change the world one line of code at a time, corny I know😂, but then my family is my world
- 👀 I’m interested in Javascript, react, now C and real terminal work
- 🌱 I’ve currently put a pause on my battle with react. Now we battle with C and SSH
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Send an email, might be real fun for both of us
